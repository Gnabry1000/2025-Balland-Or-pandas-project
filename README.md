# Ballon d'Or 2025 — Data-Driven Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the Ballon d'Or 2025 nominees using a public dataset to quantify performance across five dimensions: offensive output, availability, discipline, positional distribution, and experience vs. finishing performance. Visualizations and concise analytical write‑ups accompany each section.

## Repository structure
- data/  
  - ballondor_2025_nominees_dataset.csv
- visualizations/  
  - (PNG files generated by the notebook)
- ballandor_analysis.ipynb  
- requirements.txt
- README.md

## Key findings (summary)
- Forwards dominate nominations (~47%), midfielders ~36% — clear attacking bias.  
- Strong correlation between games started and minutes played (availability matters).  
- Weak relationship between age and finishing overperformance (r ≈ 0.3).  
- Notable disciplinary outliers (e.g., Declan Rice highest Total_Cards).

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+  
- pandas, matplotlib, scipy (optional for p-values)

Example requirements.txt:
pandas
matplotlib
scipy

## Setup (Windows)
1. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   - python -m venv venv
   - venv\Scripts\activate
2. Install dependencies:
   - pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Open the notebook:
   - jupyter notebook ballandor_analysis.ipynb

## Usage
- Run the notebook cells sequentially.  
- Visualizations are saved to `visualizations/` (see code cells that call `plt.savefig()`).

## Reproducibility notes
- Ensure `data/ballondor_2025_nominees_dataset.csv` is present.  
- Drop-in replacements for the dataset are supported if column names match.

## Suggestions for extension
- Add statistical tests and p-values for correlations.  
- Compare position-specific metrics (FW vs MF vs DF).  
- Build a simple predictive model to rank nominees objectively.
